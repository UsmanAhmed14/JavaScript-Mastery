# Values_And_Variables:

## Value
A `Value` is basically a piece of data, so its the most fundamental unit of information

```js
`jonas`
```

For example jonas in above value is a data


```js
console.log("Jonas");
console.log(23);
```




>1 most important thing we can do with values is to store them in variables that way we can use them over and over again.


```js
let firstName = "Jonas";
```

in above case we have a box called `firstName` and into that box we put the value `Jonas`and now if we want to use this variable we have to just call the label or variable name `firstname` in this case.
